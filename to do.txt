This is how the API should look like

{
    id: 1,
    name: “BucketList1”,
    items: [
                {
                    id: 1,
                    name: “I need to do X”,
                    date_created: “2015-08-12 11:57:23”,
                    date_modified: “2015-08-12 11:57:23”,
                    done: False
                }
        ]
    date_created: “2015-08-12 11:57:23”,
    date_modified: “2015-08-12 11:57:23”
    created_by: “1113456”
}
